# Troll-Custom-Faces
<b>Troll images for pawnagotchi's custom-faces</b>

These images are 64x64 pixels
  
I use Jayofelony's image for my pwnagotchi:  
https://github.com/jayofelony/pwnagotchi   

I used this video to help me create the custom-faces directory, get the images into that directory, and to set up the config.toml file.

Along with these tutorials.

However, I did not need to edit the classes as instructed to do at the bottom of the page of the 2nd URL.  
Everything worked just adding the files to a directory "custom-faces" in the root directory.  
Then edit the config.toml file to use the images instead of the emojis.  
  
    
Enjoy!
